# Create React App with SSR

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

App was not ejected, `npm run build` just was replaced with webpack.

Out-of-the-box-CRA-hot-reloading is available from `npm start` 


# Done:

✔ Saving hot-reloading from react-scripts
✔ Production build
✔ Typescript support
✔ CSS modules

# To-do:

- [ ] Server-side Redux suppport
- [ ] Server-side routing pattern (using Redux?)
- [ ] Add `styled-components` SSR support

Low prioriry:

- [ ] Add any ui-library support (`@material-ui`?)
- [ ] Remove .css build from server build if possible
- [ ] Optimize configuration build for production (add Terser, etc)
- [ ] Setup return right HTTP response code (3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
